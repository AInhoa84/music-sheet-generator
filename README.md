<div style="text-align: justify">
Guitar Tablature Generator is a project that aims to create an application capable of generating a tablature, including notes played, their value, the fret and string they are played on and the tempo of the music piece, from a raw guitar audio file. The resulting tab can be loaded into popular sheet music editor software Guitar Pro [Guitar Pro Official Website](https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php)

At present it is especially useful for guitar composers who want to easily create a tab of what they have just played, saving them the time of having to write the tab manually.
